<h1 class="display-2">Welcome</h1>
<p class="lead">This is a website I have created to help showcase some of my skills as a front-end developer. Built in Ember.js, mfryer.us uses some of the not-so-new at this point technologies of javascript frameworks to make websites quikly and extendibly. In the backend, an express application is used to serve up the blog posts which are just stored as markdown in the file system.</p>

<p>Please checkout {{#link-to "about"}}<span class="font-italic">About</span>{{/link-to}} for more information about me, {{#link-to "blogs"}}<span class="font-italic">Blogs</span>{{/link-to}} for short posts, and {{#link-to "game"}}<span class="font-italic">Game</span>{{/link-to}} for a quick typing game I made for my game design class also built in ember.js. And finally, the source for this applicaiton is available on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/HumbleHominid">GitHub</a> in the mfryer-site <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/HumbleHominid/mfryer-site">repository</a>.</p>
