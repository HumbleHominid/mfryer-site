<h1 class="display-2">About</h1>
<p class="lead">Hello there. I am Michael Fryer a Software Engineer that graduated from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mtech.edu">Montana Tech</a> in 2019 with a Bachelors in Software Engineering and Computer Science with emphisis in Game Design. During the graduation ceremony I was awarded a plaque for <em>Outstanding Achievement in the Department of Computer Science.</em></p>

<p>Over the course of my studies I took classes such as <em>Data Structures and Algorithims</em>, <em>Requirements and Specification</em>, <em>Validation and Verification</em>, and the required <em>Senior Project</em> course for Software Engineers. Over the span of two semesters, my Senior Project team and I were tasked with continuing a project from the previous year, FRED. Food, Resources, Expenses, and Distribution, or FRED for short, is a Windows application created using WPF Forms for the Butte Food Bank to aid them in tracking information about their clients such as information necessary to be reported to the state as well as when was the last time they recieved food.</p>

<p>Also during my schooling I served as the Secretary to my school's student chaper of ACM in 2017-2018 and as the President in 2018-2019. Before becoming the Secretary in 2016 I volunteered to work for one of the local museums in town, the Butte Science Mine on a project called Digital Signage. The project's vision is to bring more interactive exploration-based digital interfaces to the museum that helps children and adults learn more about a subject. Helping with that project secured my club roughly $4,000 for a future industry trip we took to Seattle where we visited companies such as Microsoft, Valve, and a couple of start ups with very few employees. As the Secretary, and again as the President, I helped my department get accreditted as a testing site for the ICPC regionals meaning schools from all around Montana can commute to Butte to compete in the competition as opposed to the next closest testing site in Colorado. Many smaller schools, including ourselves, would not have been able to compete in the competition if there was not a local testing site.</p>
