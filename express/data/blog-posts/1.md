# Website Creation - 9 June, 2019

Today I am finishing the application I started working on a long time ago to be deployed on my website at [mfryer.us](http://www.mfryer.us). The website is meant to be a brief description of my skills as a fron-end developer. Currently I am writing up a bunch of information, like this blog post, as well as all the descriptions for the home page, about page, and blog post page.
